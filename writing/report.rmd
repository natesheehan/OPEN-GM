# Abstract
Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, genomic science was lauded as pursuing a utopian vision of global scientific co-ordination and collaboration in order to discover solutions for vaccines, hospital protocols and pathogen genetic mutations. While in many ways, the increased volume, velocity and variety of genomic data sharing that happened in the height of the pandemic did indeed enable a fast track to SARS-Cov-2 solutionism, it is difficult to untangle the fields historical - and present - associations with both European and North American imperialism. Imperialist practices in genomic science embrace socio-scientifc paternalism, the invisibility of labour through the means of technology, and the dissonance among previously colonised countries and their colonising counterparts in building transparent data governance strategies. Such issues affect the vernacularisation of genomic science, the translation of data into knowledge and the way in which technology is deployed. The way in which genomic data is governed during a pandemic can have profound implications for how the science is used, and by whom. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has seen a dramatic increase in the use of genomic data, with initiatives such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform and the Covid-19 Data Portal being among the leading in facilitating open sharing. However, there are concerns that this increased sharing may not be inclusive or diverse enough, and that existing inequalities could be exacerbated. This paper will critically examine the governance of genomic data during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with a focus on inclusion and diversity. It will consider the role of different actors in data sharing, including national governments, international organisations and private companies. It will also examine the challenges involved in ensuring that all countries have access to genomic data, and that this data is representative of the global population.

# Diverse enough? A critical examination of genomic data goverenace strategies during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic

## Introduction


## Data Goverenance

### FAIR Data
The FAIR data principles have been widely endorsed by funders and institutions, and are increasingly being used as a framework for thinking about how to improve the accessibility and re-usability of research data (Wilkinson et al., 2016).  The framework has grown rapidly in recognition in and outside of academia, with over 7100 publications citing it as of July 2021 and now includes FAIR research software (Lamprecht et al 2020, Katz et al 2021). While the FAIR principles are often presented as a set of guidelines for researchers, they also have implications for data governance more broadly (REF). In particular, the FAIR principles could be seen as a way of ensuring that data is responsibly managed and used (Bezuidenhout 2020). The acronym “FAIR” stands for “Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable” and are intended to be a set of guidelines for researchers and other stakeholders involved in the management of research data. To this end, the FAIR principles specify a number of requirements that data should meet in order to be considered “FAIR”. These are documented in table 1.
