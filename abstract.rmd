<!-- The question of "how diverse is diverse enough?" is a fundamental concern in the philosophy of science, as it pertains to the relationship between diversity and knowledge production. One could say there are two main arguments for epistemic diversity; one is practical and the other is normative. The practical argument for epistemic diversity suggests that a diverse group of scientists, with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, will lead to a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the phenomena being studied. While the normative argument for epistemic diversity, suggests that diversity is necessary for the fair and just production of knowledge. This argument holds that certain groups - such as marginalised communities -have been historically excluded from the scientific process, and that by increasing diversity from these voices within the scientific community can ensure that the knowledge produced is more inclusive and representative of the pluralist perspectives of scientists around the world. Albeit, the extent to which diversity is truly achieved and its limits are still subject of ongoing philosophical inquiry. -->

<!-- The globallyco-ordinated Covid-19 genomic surveillance infrastructure provides a valuable case study for examining the limits of epistemic diversity in scientific practice. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, genomic science was lauded as pursuing a utopian vision of global scientific co-ordination and collaboration in order to discover solutions for vaccines, hospital protocols and study the pathogen genetic mutations which shook the world. While in many ways, the increased volume, velocity and variety of genomic data sharing that happened in the height of the pandemic did indeed enable a fast track to SARS-Cov-2 solutionism, it is difficult to untangle the fields historical - and present - associations with both European and North American imperialism. Imperialist practices in genomic science embrace socio-scientifc paternalism, the invisibility of labour through the means of technology, and the dissonance among previously colonised countries and their colonising counterparts. Such issues affect the vernacularisation of genomic science, the translation of data into knowledge and the way in which technology is deployed. GISAID and the Covid-19 Data Portal, have played a significant role in facilitating the sharing of genetic data on the virus. While both infrastructures share the goal of providing open access data on the virus, they differ in their policies and governance to data sharing more broadly. GISAID requires users to authenticate their identity and agree not to republish or link GISAID genomes with other datasets without permission from the data producer, while the Covid-19 Data Portal shares scientific data without restrictions. The examination of these cases allows us to explore the complex relationship between governmentality, values and incentives, and epistemic diversity. -->

<!-- In this paper, we propose a mixed methods methodology, which draws on a quantitative analysis of the two infrastructures in terms of their support for epistemic diversity, operationalised as the number of authors, institutions, ontologies, and geographies. As well as, semi-structured interviews with members and users of each database to gain a more in-depth understanding of the challenges and successes of each infrastructure in promoting epistemic diversity. this method of study allows us to explore the complex relationship between governmentality and epistemic diversity from a situated and localised position, meaning a hermentuical understanding of where the values and incentives that shape the open data policy of the infrastructure can limit or promote the diversity of knowledge and perspectives. It also raises questions about the role of institutions and their policies in shaping the diversity of scientific knowledge. -->
