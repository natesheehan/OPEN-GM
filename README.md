## Abstract

## Data and Methods
Metadata on SAS-Cov2 sequences were collected from GISAID and the Covid-19 Data Portal via their online web interfaces between the epidemiological weeks of the 23rd of December 2019 and 1st of October 2021. Epidemiological data were gathered from the complete Covid-19 dataset made available from  Our World in Data (OWID) (https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) via a stable public url. Global new case counts were extracted from this dataset which originally come from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).  

The aforementioned data sources were linked together using country codes defined by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. Percentages of Covid-19 cases sequenced per country - cumulatively and weekly - were calculated by aggregating weekly submissions and case counts using the a custom R script (https://github.com/natesheehan/OPEN-GM/blob/main/code/data-wrangle.r) Visualisations and plots were assembled using ggplot2 - a data visualisation package for the statistical programming language R - and are made accessible via the following open scripts (https://github.com/natesheehan/OPEN-GM/blob/main/code/plot-temporal-submissions.r, https://github.com/natesheehan/OPEN-GM/blob/main/code/plot-treemap.r and https://github.com/natesheehan/OPEN-GM/blob/main/code/plot-continent-landscape.r).
