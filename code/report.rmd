# Abstract
FAIR, Free and Open are conflicting concepts regarding data sharing. The differences in these philosophies are exemplified in the case of SARS-Cov2 Nucleotide Sequence databases where all three of these policies have been implemented by a range of institutions. The Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Flu Data (GISAID) have shared virus data through a restricted access repository, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) shared their data under the FAIR principles and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) guarantees free and unrestricted access to virus data. We examine each of these databases and discuss their limitations and benefits towards achieving responsible data sharing. In this paper I will argue that the way in which SARS-COV2 genome data has been shared and used reflects a lack of understanding of the ethical implications of such sharing, as well as a failure to consider the unequal power relations between different actors involved in the scientific process. To make this point I will draw on a range of data-centric methodologies, from network visualisation of key actors involved in data sharing policies, network and textual analysis from a large corpus of genomic surveillance papers and a Bayesian nonparametric regression model of institutional diversity indicators.

# Diverse enough? A critical examination of genomic data goverenace strategies during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic

## Introduction


Epistemic diversity is generally agreed among social epistemologists as a means of producing new scientific theories (creativity) and challenging existing scientific paradigms (dissent). As a theory, epistemic diversity has been popularised by feminist philosophy of science discourse who dismiss the lassier faire approach – also known as the the invisible hand where no intervention in increasing diversity is thought necessary. The two factors of creativity and dissent bevel the possibilities of knowledge generation in a pluralistic fashion by altering the discourse surrounding accepted or normative scientific theories and practices (Solomon 2007). Firstly, dissent, challenges the hegemony of a particular scientific theory or practice by offering an altered projection of theories or strategises worth pursing. This can happen in a number of ways such as through criticism (Mill,Popper, Feyerband Longino), division of cognitive labour (Kitcher, Solomon), and distribution of knowledge (Harraway, Longino). Secondly, creativity, broadens the range of what count as legitimate scientific theories and practices by introducing new ideas, methods, and perspectives. This approach has been explored in Open Science initiatives by identifying the number of factors in which can shape a diverse Open Science project. These include, but are not limited to a diversification of methods, characteristics of researchers, funding, geo-political location and intellectual property regimes (Leonelli 2021). Both dissent and creativity are important in epistemic diversity because they help to create a space for alternative ways of knowing and doing science. By introducing new ideas and methods, epistemic diversity challenges the hegemony of traditional science and opens up new possibilities for knowledge generation (Ghosh 2021;Menezes de Souza 2021).


<b>What are they various data sharing strategies? </b>

### FAIR Data
The FAIR data principles have been widely endorsed by funders and institutions, and are increasingly being used as a framework for thinking about how to improve the accessibility and re-usability of research data (Wilkinson et al., 2016).  The framework has grown rapidly in recognition in and outside of academia, with over 7100 publications citing it as of July 2021 and now includes FAIR research software (Lamprecht et al 2020, Katz et al 2021). While the FAIR principles are often presented as a set of guidelines for researchers, they also have implications for data governance more broadly (REF). In particular, the FAIR principles could be seen as a way of ensuring that data is responsibly managed and used (Bezuidenhout 2020). The acronym “FAIR” stands for “Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable” and are intended to be a set of guidelines for researchers and other stakeholders involved in the management of research data. To this end, the FAIR principles specify a number of requirements that data should meet in order to be considered “FAIR”. These are documented in table 1.
